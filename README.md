## Installation
1. First off, you'll want to run & download [Borderlands Voice Activation](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BorderlandsVoiceActivation/releases/download/1.0/BorderlandsVoiceActivation.rar).
2. Extract the .exe file somewhere.
3. I would recommend training Windows (7/10) to understand your voice better.
   1. Open the Start Menu 
   2. Click `Control Panel`.
   3. Click `Ease of Access`.
   4. Click `Speech Recognition`.
   5. Open `Train your computer to better understand you.`
   6. Follow the instructions Windows gives you.
4. Next off, run the program.
5. Now you setup the program, it'll ask you for what keys you want to use.
   1. It'll ask you for your "move forward" key, in general this is `W`.
   2. Next up, is the "move backward" key, this is normally `S`.
   3. Once again, the "move left" key is up at bat, generally put, `A`.
   4. You'll get, "move right", you'll put whatever your move right key is, generally, `D`.
   5. You'll get, "Crouch", in vanilla, you put, `C`.
   6. Once more, "Use" is up, normally the key is, `E`.
   7. The next question I badger you with, is "What is your "Reload" key", the normal answer to this is, `R`.
   8. `What is your "Honk" key?`, in Vanilla the answer is, `Z`
   9. `What is your "Melee" key?`, normally one answer's `V`.
   10. `What is your "Action Skill" key?`, normally, `F`.
   11. `What is your "Grenade" key?`, generally the answer is, `G`.
6. Since you've now setup *Borderlands Voice Activation*, you're setup. You'll probably want to know the key bindings.
